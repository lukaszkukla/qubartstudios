                <p>We cannot recommend Jacob high enough. We knew that he was taking absolutely fantastic pictures,
                    but
                    the ones that we got from him even exceeded our expectations. He was professional, helpful and
                    funny. Even if I was a bit nervous about posing he put me on ease and the final result was just
                    amazing! He managed to capture such a moments, that we were laughing and crying watching the
                    presentation he provide us with. What we absolutely loved was the photo album, so pretty and
                    classy.
