## design choices

### fonts
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts"). The main text is [Noto Sans](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans&display=swap "Noto Sans"). [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?query=rob "Poppins") is used for the headers and the navigation bar. 

### icons
I used [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome") for extra visual cues.

### colors



![color Pallet]()
 
 * #fff - navigation bar color
 * #fbfbfb - main background color
 * #000 - font color

### structure
Website is responsive with min-size of iPhone 4 (320px)
The screen size breakpoints are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |

# wireframes
I use [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/ "diagrams.net") to develop wireframes for the website. 
wireframes are designed for large screen only. I used [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/mobile/ "Mozilla Firefox") and [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ie/chrome/ "Chrome") developer tools to scale down and adjust design for smaller screens.

The wireframe of pages below:

[portfolio page](assets/wireframes/portfolio.png "portfolio wireframe")

[about page](assets/wireframes/about.png "about wireframe")

There is a visual cue to inform user on which section or page is currently visible. 

On smaller devices (<992px), navigation bar changes to "hamburger" style.

    - the image spans almost over the whole height of the screen and gives the user clear message about the intent of the website

# testing

I feel that I achieved agreed goals. The site is responsive. Images were optimised for web use to load faster yet still look sharp and crips. Website is clean and simple, there is no noise to discrat the user. Each section was designed with minimalist approach. Navigation bar is sticky on all devices and on large devices upward phone number and email addres is always visible.

Contact form requires minimum information to not to overwhelm potential customer. 

Social media links are clear visible in the footer and open up in the separate tab so the user can always come back to the main website.

\
&nbsp;


The biggest challenge and lesson learnt was that I designed the site for the large screen first 1200px and up. This caused a number of issues when trying to scale down.
In the end I decided to refactor the whole code for the small devices firsst and use media queris to scale up for larger devices. I added grid and flex to ensure that the pages scaled nicely. 
It was chellenging and frustrating at times but it was always fun time.

![css](wireframes/css-peter.gif "css for beginners")


During testing
 * Hero text was too smal for devices from 568 upwards so I added media query just to deal with it
 
 * ~~In my wireframes, I had designed to only have a 'Join Us' button on the larger screen sizes. While I was developing the site, this did not make sense. There was such a long scroll with it being a one-page site, I felt I needed to speed up the movement for someone who was instantly interested so included it on all screen sizes.~~

 * ~~On actual smaller devices, instead of on Chrome Developer, the main navigation menu did not show the 'Contact' link. I simply changed the styling of the links and the changed the ul to flex-start and all is now clearly visible.~~

 * ~~I was having issues with the navigation bar scrolling about 15px when I scrolled down on smaller devices whilst working on Chrome Developer. I lost a lot of time trying to figure out the issue, but when I tried the site on an acual device, the navigation bar stayed fixed as the code dictated. This was a bug in Chrome Developer and not with my site.~~

 * ~~The main navigation on smaller devices was initially set to 90vh, however on testing on a physical device, the user could see the site scrolling at the bottom if they were to slide up or down. This looked very poor and clumsy on the eye, so I adjusted it to 100vh to cover it up.~~

 * ~~I found that I was repeating a lot of code in my style.css file in order to center items. I created a class to do this and then applied it whee needed.~~

 * ~~All my buttons were styled completely differently. I added an animation to all buttons so there is a continuity between them all.~~

 * ~~When I was validating HTML code, I had one error showing. This was in the contact form where I had a method of '#'. I was under the understanding that POST method should have been used, but when I did, it caused an error instead of going to my contact.html page. After a while I tried using GET and it worked solving my validation problem. The results of my validation for HTML and CSS are below.~~

    - HTML (index.html) validator [results](wireframes/html-validate.jpg "W3C HTML")
    - HTML (contact.html) validator [results](wireframes/html-contact-validate.jpg "W3C HTML")
    - CSS validator [results](wireframes/css-validate.jpg "W3C CSS")
\
&nbsp;

 ~~On testing on a physical mobile device, I thought that the google search bar looked odd, being white and my header a dark color. For user experiance and to make it look cleaner and more fluid, I changed the color to match using the following code.~~

 ```

 <meta name="theme-color" content="#121A18">


 ```

 * ~~When going through my UX section, to ensure that all my goals were met for the project, I noticed that I had missed one, 'As a user, I want to know that the club is well established'. I adjusted the text in the welcome section to suit.~~
\
&nbsp;

## unfixed bugs

~~My learning has limited my use of the hamburger for smaller devices. It works nicely to open the menu up, but a tap of the hamburger again should close the menu down again. It does not do this, and the link has to be selected to enable the user to exit out of it. From my research it seems that all the streamline methods are using JavaScript and I am yet to learn this.~~
